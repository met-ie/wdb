 * Abstract class for creating CppUnit wci installtests. Provides database 
 * connection and transaction managemet.
 * 
 * All subclasses of AbstractWciTestFixture share a connection to the database.
 * This means that subclasses are neither thread safe nor reentrant. However,
 * this allows a very large number of instances of this class to exist 
 * simultaneously without exhausting the database's maximum number of 
 * connections. 
 * 
 * Transaction management consists of using the methods setUp() and tearDown()
 * to call BEGIN TRANSACTION and ROLLBACK, respectively. setUp() is called just 
 * before each test runs, and tearDown() just after each test has run. This 
 * means that all modifications performed by the tests will be undone just 
 * after each test has run, giving each test the same initial view of the 
 * database.  
 * 
 * @see CppUnit documentation http://cppunit.sourceforge.net/doc/lastest/ for 
 * information on how to write CppUnit tests.
