WDB - Database Schema
============================================================

The database schema of WDB version 1.0.0 are defined in a number of SQL files
distributed over several repositories.

Each time the data model is changed, the SCHEMA_VERSION of the database is
incremented.

Each SCHEMA_VERSION is associated with a wdbUpgradeXXXX script in src/database
(where XXXX = SCHEMA_VERSION); when a database is upgraded from one version
to the next, only the upgrade scripts for the added SCHEMA_VERSIONs are 
added.

This essentially means that the only time one can be guaranteed that a 
base WDB file is run, is during the initial install of the database.

For upgrading, all schema changes should always go into the wdbUpgradeXXXX
scripts.
